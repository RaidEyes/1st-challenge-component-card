### What I learned

I learn to start coding for the mobile version first and then use @media querry  for desktop changes.

The challenge was very hard especially when I'm a complete beginner in this coding field. However after this challenge, I managed to build some connections with people from the Slack community. They helped me get through this challenge.

### Continued development

I still need to revise the @media querry and do more challenges because this is very important.

### Useful resources

freecodecamp.org - This is the site that I got recommended from an IT friend, it helped my brain get together.
